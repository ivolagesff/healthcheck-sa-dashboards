## Merged Queries

Merged queries within Looker allow for the visualisation of data across multiple explores within one single tile. They are ideal when there is a requirment to render data from two seprate databased within the one tile. They are however expensive in both time and memory utilisation. Ensuring that they are use appropriately and minimised when created within one single connection can see notable performance improvement within a Looker instance.
