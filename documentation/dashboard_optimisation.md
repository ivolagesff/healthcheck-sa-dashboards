# Dashboard Optimisation
This dashboard has been created as a resource in order to provide a summary of a dashboard which may have poor performance.\
It contains a number of tiles, described below, which flag potential issues within the dashboard. There is a manditory filter on\ dashboard title which can only accept one selection. There are optional filters for Query Created Date, Explore, Model, Query Status,\ if the query originated in Development or Production mode, Its source (e.g. User, Schedules, API, Embed) and the specific user querying\ the dashboard.

## Created by 
Who created this dashboard. If they arenâ€™t available who is the last\
      person to update it?

## Dashboard Has Filters
The more data that is returned in an individual element, the more\
      memory resources will be consumed. Dashboard elements that are returned with\
      many thousands of data points will use more memory. Ensuring that a filter is\
      present ensures that dashboards return data promptly. If the dashboard does\
      not have any filters, Consider aggregation if no filters are required and the\
      level of usage merits.
## Run On Load
If the use case for a dashboard anticipates that the user must update\
      filters in order to gain useful insights, turn off run on load feature as this\
      prevents sending unnecessary queries to the database.

## Has Merged Queries
Merged queries add overhead to Looker runtime by both adding additional\
      queries to the dashboard as well as increasing post query processing. Consider\
      creating explores which make merged queries redundant where possible.

## Has Custom Fields
The more post-query processing features used, the more memory is consumed.\
      If you are using custom fields across multiple Looks and dashboards, consider\
      hard-coding them into your LookML model wherever possible. Doing so will reduce\
      the prepare time below as well as Stream to cache.\

## Has Pivots
The more dimensions that are pivoted in a Look or dashboard tile, the\
      more memory is consumed when the dashboard is loaded. This is because more data\
      is used as more data is returned. If the dimension you are pivoting has high\
      cardinality (many unique values), there will be a column for each value. Filter\
      at the dashboard or Look level to allow the user to select the dimension values\
      that they are most interested in comparing, as opposed to showing everything\
      at once.

## Number of Explores
Looker Dashboards can source tiles from any number of dashboards.\
      Each explore sources its data from one base table and joins other tables as\
      necessary. Identify if you can source the same information on a tile from and\
      explore which queries less data. E.g. get user detail from a user explore rather\
      than transaction.

## Totals Query Tiles
The number of query tiles on the dashboard

## Dashboard Has a Date Filter
The more data that is returned in an individual element, the more\
      memory resources will be consumed. Dashboard elements that are returned with\
      many thousands of data points will use more memory. Ensuring that a date filter\
      is present ensures that dashboards return data promptly.

## Auto Refresh Enabled?
Auto Refresh is a feature which executes all queries on the dashboard\
      at a regular interval and bypasses Looker Cache. This can have a significant\
      impact on overall Looker performance by occupying query slots and creating a\
      queue of queries. Auto Refresh should only be enabled for dashboards which are\
      shown on public displays or trading desks.

## Number of Merged queries
The number of tiles on the dashboard which have merged queries

## Number of Custom fields
The number of tiles on the dashboard which are leveraging custom fields.

## Tiles of Pivots
The number of tiles with pivots on the dashboard. A large number of pivot tiles can see a high stream to cache time. Consider reducing\ the number of pivots in the dashboard via restructuring of data.

## Last Queried
When was this dashboard last queried. Is it being used on a daily, weekly or monthly basis? This may also infer if the report is being\ queries only at peak usage times such as first day of the month or week. 

## Total Queries
The total number of queries which have been generated by this dashboard. Optimisation should be focused on dashboards with a high\ volume of query traffic or with a specific stratigic use case such as quarterly reports or embedded dashboards.

## Queries with Date Filter
The number of which which have a date filter applied. Ensure that a date filter is present where possible and this date is ideally used\ for partitioning. 

## Dashboard Runs
The number of times the dashboard has run.

## Max Row Limit on Dashboard
The maximum number of rows any tile queries. if any are set to 5,000\
      or any number beyond 500 review as more data streamed to cache means greater\
      memory requirements and Longer runtime

## Error Queries
The number of Errors generated by the dashboard. Review if there is\
      a required filter and dashboard is set to run on load as an initial check and\
      query about depreciated schedules if notable.

## Full Dashboard Completed Average Runtime
The time it take in total for the dashboard to load. A high difference between the average query runtime and full dashboard load\ suggest specific tiles which are taking longer to load and should be reviewed.

## Average Tile Database Execution Time
The time on average it takes for Looker to process your query in the database.

## Stream to Cache Time
Once your query has finished in the database. This is the time it\
       takes in seconds to process and stream results to the render cache. This can\
       be reduced by reducing the number of pivots & number of Table Calculations\
       in the dashboard. 

## Initialisation from Cache
Time it takes in seconds to pull initialization from cache. This should\
      be present on the majority of your queries.

## Initialisation from Compute
The Average time it takes to validate and initialise underlying LookML\
      code from scratch. This should only apply to a small proportion of queries

## Prepare Average
The average amount of time taken to generate necessary SQL from your\
      LookML model as well as create sql from custom dimenisons and measures. This\
      can be reduced by simplifying LookML Logic where possible and moving custom\
      dimensions to your LookML model.
